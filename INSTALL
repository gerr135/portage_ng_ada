Install instructions.

Autotools are an overkill for this demonstration. Setting them up would have taken
more time than I spent on the whole suit :), howeher a very basic Makefile
is all what is necessary, and even that is provided mostly for the easy
"make clean" functionality, as both programs can be simply built with one command (each).

Prerequesits:
you naturally need gnat (a gcc-based Ada compiler). I also made use of Booch components.
Both are available im portage, just emerge away:

emerge gnat booch_components

gnat-3.15p is the latest stable version. There are few alpha versions of gnat-5.0 in portage
as well, but I would recommend at this time to stick with 3.15p, as
1. It is rock-stable
2. You get bunch of docs and will be able to emerge asis to get few small
	but usefull tools. However the presented code should compile fine with either version.
As such, the ~arch users might want to add >=dev-lang/gnat-5.0_pre20030822
to their /etc/portage/package.mask

Make sure you parsed /etc/profile and, after you installled booch_components,
that /etc/env.d/55booch_components has been parsed as well. If you have more than
one library from dev-ada installed you might need to manually do
. /etc/env.d/55booch_components
until bug #32188 is resolved

After that just run make in proto_portage directory.
make clean  to wipe generates objects and executables
